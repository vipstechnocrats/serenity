                        Experiencing occasional anxiety is a normal part of life, but people with anxiety disorders often have intense, excessive, and persistent worry and fear about everyday situations. These feelings, accompanied by physical tension and other behavioral and cognitive symptoms, are difficult to control, cause significant distress, and can last a long time if untreated. Anxiety disorders interfere with daily activities, impairing family, social, school, or working life.
                        <br>
                        An estimated 4% of the global population currently experience an anxiety disorder. In 2019, 301 million people worldwide had an anxiety disorder, making it the most common mental disorder. Although highly effective treatments for anxiety disorders exist, only about 1 in 4 people in need (27.6%) receive any treatment. Barriers to care include a lack of awareness that anxiety is a treatable health condition, insufficient investment in mental health services, a shortage of trained healthcare providers, and social stigma. Addressing these barriers is crucial for improving access to treatment and support for those affected by anxiety disorders. Enhanced public education and mental health resources can help bridge the gap and ensure more individuals receive the help they need.

                    Anxiety disorders, like other mental health conditions, result from a complex interaction of social, psychological and biological factors. Anyone can have an anxiety disorder, but people who have lived through abuse, severe losses or other adverse experiences are more likely to develop one.
                    <br>
                    Anxiety disorders are closely related to and affected by physical health. Many of the impacts of anxiety (such as physical tension, nervous system hyperactivity or harmful use of alcohol) are also known risk factors for diseases such as cardiovascular disease. In turn, people with these diseases may also find themselves experiencing anxiety disorders due to the difficulties associated with managing their conditions.
                    <br> <br>
                    It's possible that your anxiety may be due to an underlying medical condition if:
                    <ul class="list-disc list-inside">
                        <li> You don't have any blood relatives (such as a parent or sibling) with an anxiety disorder</li>
                        <li> You didn't have an anxiety disorder as a child</li>
                        <li>You don't avoid certain things or situations because of anxiety</li>
                        <li>You have a sudden occurrence of anxiety that seems unrelated to life events and you didn't have a previous history of anxiety</li>
                    </ul>
                    </p>

                <div class="accordion-content px-4 py-2">
                    <p>See your doctor if:
                    <ul class="list-disc list-inside">
                        <li>You feel like you're worrying too much and it's interfering with your work, relationships or other parts of your life</li>
                        <li>Your fear, worry or anxiety is upsetting to you and difficult to control</li>
                        <li>You feel depressed, have trouble with alcohol or drug use, or have other mental health concerns along with anxiety</li>
                        <li>You think your anxiety could be linked to a physical health problem</li>
                        <li>You have suicidal thoughts or behaviors — if this is the case, seek emergency treatment immediately</li>
                    </ul>
                    Your worries may not go away on their own, and they may get worse over time if you don't seek help. See your doctor or a mental health provider before your anxiety gets worse. It's easier to treat if you get help early.

                    Depression results from a complex interaction of social, psychological, and biological factors. People who have gone through adverse life events (unemployment, bereavement, traumatic events) are more likely to develop depression. Depression can, in turn, lead to more stress and dysfunction and worsen the affected person's life situation and the depression itself.<br><br>
                    Depression is closely related to and affected by physical health. Many of the factors that influence depression (such as physical inactivity or harmful use of alcohol) are also known risk factors for diseases such as cardiovascular disease, cancer, diabetes and respiratory diseases. In turn, people with these diseases may also find themselves experiencing depression due to the difficulties associated with managing their condition.<br><br>
                    Prevention programmes have been shown to reduce depression. Effective community approaches to prevent depression include school-based programmes to enhance a pattern of positive coping in children and adolescents. Interventions for parents of children with behavioural problems may reduce parental depressive symptoms and improve outcomes for their children. Exercise programmes for older persons can also be effective in depression prevention.<br><br>

                    <p>
                    There are effective treatments for depression. These include psychological treatment and medications. Seek care if you have symptoms of depression.<br>
                    Psychological treatments are the first treatments for depression. They can be combined with antidepressant medications in moderate and severe depression. Antidepressant medications are not needed for mild depression.<br>
                    Psychological treatments can teach new ways of thinking, coping or relating to others. They may include talk therapy with professionals and supervised lay therapists. Talk therapy can happen in person or online. Psychological treatments may be accessed through self-help manuals, websites and apps. <br>

                        Stress is a natural human reaction that happens to everyone. In fact, your body is designed to experience stress and react to it. When you experience changes or challenges (stressors), your body produces physical and mental responses. That's stress. Stress responses help your body adjust to new situations. Stress can be positive — keeping you alert, motivated, and ready to avoid danger. For example, if you have an important test coming up, a stress response might help your body work harder and stay awake longer. However, stress becomes a problem when stressors continue without relief or periods of relaxation. 
                        <br>
                        Chronic stress can lead to a variety of health issues, such as high blood pressure, heart disease, obesity, and diabetes. It can also affect your mental health, leading to anxiety, depression, and other disorders. Recognizing the signs of chronic stress and addressing them is crucial. Implementing stress management techniques, such as mindfulness, regular exercise, or seeking professional counseling, can significantly improve your overall well-being and help you cope more effectively. Additionally, maintaining a balanced lifestyle and fostering supportive relationships can provide further resilience against stress.

                <dd>Acute stress is short-term stress that comes and goes quickly. It can be positive or negative. It's the feeling you get when you're riding on a rollercoaster or having a fight with your boyfriend. Everyone experiences acute stress from time to time.</dd>
                <dt class="font-semibold">Episodic acute stress:</dt>
                <dd> Episodic acute stress is when you experience acute stress on a regular basis. With this kind of stress, you don't ever get the time you need to return to a calm, relaxed state. Episodic stress frequently affects people working in certain professions, like healthcare providers.</dd>
                <dt class="font-semibold">Chronic stress:</dt>
                <dd>Chronic stress is long-term stress that goes on for weeks or months. You may experience chronic stress due to marriage troubles, issues at work or financial problems. It's important to find ways to manage chronic stress because it can lead to health issues.</dd>

                    Stress is how your body reacts to a change or challenge, and many different things can lead to it. Stressors can also be positive or negative. For instance, getting a new job or losing a job can both cause stress. Other causes of stress include:
                    <ul class="list-disc list-inside">
                        <li>An illness or death of a loved one.</li>

                    </ul>
                    Stress can also be acute, meaning short term. Causes of acute stress may include everyday stressors, like:

                        <li>Studying for a big test.</li>

                    If you're not sure if stress is the cause, or if you've taken steps to control your stress but you keep having symptoms, see your health care provider. Your health care provider may want to check for other potential causes. Or think about seeing a counselor or therapist, who can help you find the sources of your stress and learn new coping tools. And if you are concerned about harming yourself, call 112 or a suicide hotline.<br>
                    Also, get emergency help right away if you have chest pain, especially if you also have shortness of breath; jaw, back, shoulder or arm pain; sweating; dizziness; or nausea. These may be warning signs of a heart attack and not simply stress symptoms.

                    A panic attack is a sudden episode of intense fear that triggers severe physical reactions when there is no real danger or apparent cause. Panic attacks can be very frightening. When panic attacks occur, you might think you're losing control, having a heart attack or even dying.<br>
                    Many people have just one or two panic attacks in their lifetimes, and the problem goes away, perhaps when a stressful situation ends. But if you've had recurrent, unexpected panic attacks and spent long periods in constant fear of another attack, you may have a condition called panic disorder.<br>
                    Although panic attacks themselves aren't life-threatening, they can be frightening and significantly affect your quality of life. But treatment can be very effective.<br>
                    Women are twice as likely than men to be diagnosed with panic disorder. The disorder usually develops in the late teens or early adulthood.<br>

                Panic attacks typically begin suddenly, without warning. They can strike at any time — when you're driving a car, at the mall, sound asleep or in the middle of a business meeting. You may have occasional panic attacks, or they may occur frequently.
                Panic attacks have many variations, but symptoms usually peak within minutes. You may feel fatigued and worn out after a panic attack subsides.
                Panic attacks typically include some of these signs or symptoms:
                <ul class="list-disc list-inside">
                    <li>Sense of impending doom or danger</li>
                    <li>Fear of loss of control or death</li>
                    <li>Rapid, pounding heart rate</li>
                    <li>Sweating</li>
                    <li>Trembling or shaking</li>
                    <li>Shortness of breath or tightness in your throat</li>
                    <li>Chills</li>
                    <li>Hot flashes</li>
                    <li>Nausea</li>
                    <li>Abdominal cramping</li>
                    <li>Chest pain</li>
                    <li>Headache</li>
                    <li>Dizziness, lightheadedness or faintness</li>
                    <li>Numbness or tingling sensation</li>
                    <li>Feeling of unreality or detachment</li>
                </ul>
                One of the worst things about panic attacks is the intense fear that you'll have another one. You may fear having panic attacks so much that you avoid certain situations where they may occur.

            It's not known what causes panic attacks or panic disorder, but these factors may play a role:
            <ul class="list-disc list-inside">
                <li>Genetics</li>
                <li>Major stress</li>

                <li>Certain changes in the way parts of your brain function</li>
            </ul>
            Panic attacks may come on suddenly and without warning at first, but over time, they're usually triggered by certain situations.
           <br><br>
            Some research suggests that your body's natural fight-or-flight response to danger is involved in panic attacks. For example, if a grizzly bear came after you, your body would react instinctively. Your heart rate and breathing would speed up as your body prepared for a life-threatening situation. Many of the same reactions occur in a panic attack. But it's unknown why a panic attack occurs when there's no obvious danger present.

            If you have panic attack symptoms, seek medical help as soon as possible. Panic attacks, while intensely uncomfortable, are not dangerous. But panic attacks are hard to manage on your own, and they may get worse without treatment.<br>
            Panic attack symptoms can also resemble symptoms of other serious health problems, such as a heart attack, so it's important to get evaluated by your primary care provider if you aren't sure what's causing your symptoms.
